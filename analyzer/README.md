# Earthquake Branch Analyzer

Just finding bugs is not enough for improving quality of the target software.

The quality gets improved only after identifying the root cause of bugs, and fixing them.

Earthquake provides event history storage for estimating bug causes.

We are also planning to add support for analyzing branch-coverage data (e.g. using JaCoCo) so as to pick up suspicious branch patterns.


Supported languages:

 * Java, Scala (JaCoCo)
 * Go (go cover)
